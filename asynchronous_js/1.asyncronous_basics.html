    <!--Let's understand Synchronous first:- 
        lets's take a example if u wanna fetch some data from server and taht is taking much time unless and untile it don't complete it's fetching u cant move forward so this what the synchronous programming all about and that is the limitation.-->

    <!--Now let's move on Asynchronous Programming:-
        here u don't need to wait to finish task and move forward tasks are done in asynchronous manner.

        there r few ways to work with asyn code
        - callback funcs(func call and declares at same code or there is no exlicitely call to func.).
        - promises
        - async/await

    -->


    <!-- Ajax (Asynchronous Javascript and XML)
    Ajax is not any framework or liabrary it's just a technology to transport data over web from client to server in asynchronous manner.
    - it's done without refreshing the page
    - JSON has replace most of part of XML.
    -->

    <!-- XmlHttpRequest(XHR) Object
        this is core technology in ajax, it's provided by browser 
    -->
